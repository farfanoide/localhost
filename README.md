# Local server directory listing

Just a script to "beautify" your local server.

##Installation
to install drop index.php to the root of your local server.

##Disclaimer
i don't recommend using this on your web server as it is vulnerable to attacks. this is intended for local use only.
browser support was not a concern while writing this so it'll only work in modern browsers.
